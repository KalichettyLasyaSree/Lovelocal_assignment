EASY_1 question:Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
Alogrithm:
Input: A string s consisting of words and spaces.
Output: The length of the last word in the string.
Steps:
1.Initialize an empty list: words = []
2.Traverse the string s from the beginning:For each character c:
   If c is a space character:
        If the current word is not empty:
           Append the current word to the words list.
           Reset the current word to an empty string.
        Otherwise (c is not a space character):
        Append c to the current word.
3.If the current word is not empty:
Append the current word to the words list.
4.Check if the words list is empty:
If it is empty, return 0.
5.Get the last word: last_word = words[-1]
6.Return the length of the last word: len(last_word)
code:
def length_of_last_word(s):
    words = s.split()
    if not words:
        return 0
    return len(words[-1])

while True:
    s = input()
    if 1 <= len(s) <= 104 and all(ch.isalpha() or ch.isspace() for ch in s):
        break
   
result = length_of_last_word(s)
print(result)
logic:
1.Splitting the string into words: The split method is used as it efficiently separates the string into individual words based on the provided delimiter (whitespace in this case). This simplifies further processing by focusing only on words.
2.Checking the presence of words: We need to ensure the string actually contains words before proceeding. If the "words" list is empty, it implies there are no words in the string, and we immediately return 0 as the length.
3.Getting the last word: We access the last element of the "words" list using negative indexing (-1). This effectively retrieves the last word in the string.
4.Determining the length of the last word: The len function is used to count the number of characters in the last word obtained in step 3.
5.Returning the length: Finally, we return the calculated length of the last word as the desired output.
