Hard 3 question:Given an integer n, count the total number of digit 1 appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.
logic:
1.Initialization:
   Initialize a variable count to keep track of the total number of digit 1 occurrences.
   Initialize a variable factor to 1 to represent the current digit place (1s, 10s, 100s, ...).
2.Digit-wise Iteration:
  Iterate through each digit place in the number n.
  Calculate higher, current_digit, and lower for the current digit place.
3.Counting Digit 1:
  If current_digit is 0, add higher * factor to the count.
  If current_digit is 1, add (higher * factor) + lower + 1 to the count.
  If current_digit is greater than 1, add (higher + 1) * factor to the count.
4.Update Factor:
  Multiply factor by 10 to move to the next digit place.
5.Update Current:
  Update the value of current by dividing n by the updated factor.
6.Repeat Until All Digits Processed:
  Repeat the process until all digits in n have been processed.
7.Return Count:
  Return the final count.

algortithm:
1.Steps:Initialize count and factor to 1.
   Initialize current as n // factor.
   Enter a while loop while current > 0:
   Calculate higher, current_digit, and lower.
   Update count based on the rules described in the logic.
   Update factor and current for the next iteration.
   Return the final count.
2.User Input and Function Call:
Accept user input for the integer n.
Call the count_digit_one function with the input integer.
3.Print Result:
Print the total number of digit 1 occurrences in all non-negative integers less than or equal to n.

code:
def count_digit_one(n):
    count = 0
    factor = 1
    current = n // factor

    while current > 0:
        higher = n // (factor * 10)
        current_digit = current % 10
        lower = n - (current * factor)

        if current_digit == 0:
            count += higher * factor
        elif current_digit == 1:
            count += higher * factor + lower + 1
        else:
            count += (higher + 1) * factor
        factor *= 10
        current = n // factor
    return count
n = int(input())
if 0 <= n <= 109:
    result = count_digit_one(n)
    print(result)
